# knk_courier
In this project a full webpage (frontend and backend) is developed.

Firstly,an administrator can edit the database and create, update and delete records.

In the process of sending a shipment, dijkstra's algorithm is used in order to find the optimal route through a set of hubs. Also a QR code is printed and scanned in each hub to mark that the package has passed from each location.

Finally, clients can track their shipments through a unique id and spot the current location on a map as well as find the nearest store through an inserted zip code.
